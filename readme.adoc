If you are in a hurry and want to get hands-on with Istio insanely fast, just go to http://learn.openshift.com/servicemesh[http://learn.openshift.com/servicemesh] and start instantly


There are three different and super simple microservices in this system and they are chained together in the following sequence:

```
customer → preference → recommendation
```

For now, they have a simple exception handling solution for dealing with a missing dependent service: it just returns the error message to the end-user.

There are two more simple apps that illustrate how Istio handles egress routes: link:egress/egressgithub[`egressgithub`] and link:egress/egresshttpbin[`egresshttpbin`]
